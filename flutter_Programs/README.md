# flutter_Programs

This folder contains 10 small Flutter example Dart files. These files are standalone Flutter `main()` apps meant to be used inside a Flutter project (for example, copy one file's content into `lib/main.dart` of a Flutter project or paste the widget into an existing project).

Files included:
- `hello_world.dart` - Simple Hello World app.
- `counter_app.dart` - Stateful counter with increment/decrement.
- `list_view_demo.dart` - ListView demo with separators.
- `grid_view_demo.dart` - GridView example.
- `navigation_demo.dart` - Navigation between two screens.
- `form_validation.dart` - Simple form with validation.
- `animation_demo.dart` - AnimatedContainer tap demo.
- `drawer_demo.dart` - App with a navigation drawer.
- `theme_demo.dart` - Toggle between light and dark themes.
- `responsive_layout.dart` - Responsive layout example (List on narrow, Grid on wide).

How to use
1. Create a new Flutter project (if you don't have one):
   flutter create my_app
2. Replace `lib/main.dart` with the contents of any of the example files, or import the example and call its top-level widget in your project.
3. Run the app:
   flutter run

Notes
- These examples avoid external package dependencies so they should run in a default Flutter project.
- If you want fully independent runnable projects for each example, I can create 10 separate Flutter projects (this will take longer and requires Flutter tooling).
